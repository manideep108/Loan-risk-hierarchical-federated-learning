# Loan Prediction HFL Simulation

Privacy-preserving loan risk prediction using Hierarchical Federated Learning. Simulates distributed, non-IID client data and multi-server federated aggregation.

## Key Results

- Achieved ~88.5% global model accuracy after 10 rounds.
- Robustness measured under non-IID data and client variation.
